Title: Spatial Interpolation of Electoral Data via Inverse Distance Weighting
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Rogerio", "Barbosa", role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Interpolates voting counts and electoral demographics from
    polling locations into census tracts using inverse distance weighting
    with Sinkhorn-balanced weights and per-zone optimized decay parameters.
    Travel-time matrices are computed via the r5r routing engine.
    Optimization uses per-bracket mini-batch stochastic gradient descent
    (PB-SGD) with log-domain Sinkhorn projections on CPU or GPU via torch.
    Each demographic bracket receives its own Sinkhorn balancing, and
    mini-batching enables efficient scaling to large cities. Includes
    end-to-end helpers for Brazilian electoral data that auto-download
    census, electoral, and road network data.
