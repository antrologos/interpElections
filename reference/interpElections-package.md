# interpElections: Spatial Interpolation of Electoral Data via Inverse Distance Weighting

Spatial interpolation of electoral data via inverse distance weighting
with column-normalized weights and per-census-tract optimized decay
parameters. Designed for disaggregating voting results from polling
locations into census tracts using travel-time-based IDW. Optimization
uses torch autograd (ADAM) on CPU or GPU.
