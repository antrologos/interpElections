\usage{
setup_osmium(method = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Character or NULL. Installation method to use.
If NULL (default), auto-detects. Options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"conda"}: conda install (all platforms)
\item \code{"brew"}: Homebrew (macOS)
\item \code{"apt"}: apt-get (Debian/Ubuntu)
\item \code{"dnf"}: dnf (Fedora/RHEL)
\item \code{"download"}: Download osmconvert binary (Windows only)
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the path to the installed tool, or NULL if
installation failed.
}
\description{
Attempts to install \code{osmium-tool} (or \code{osmconvert} as a fallback)
using the system package manager. This is required to clip large
state-level OSM extracts down to municipality-level bounding boxes
for r5r routing.
}
\details{
The preferred tool is \code{osmium-tool}, which is faster and more
reliable. \code{osmconvert} is used as a fallback when osmium is not
available.

On Windows, the \code{"download"} method fetches a pre-compiled
\code{osmconvert.exe} binary and saves it to the interpElections cache.
This does not require conda or any other package manager.
