\usage{
leave_one_out(result, max_stations = 30L, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{An \code{interpElections_result} object.}

\item{max_stations}{Integer. Maximum stations to evaluate. If the
municipality has more stations, a random sample is used.
Default: 30.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress? Default: TRUE.}

\value{
A data frame with one row per evaluated station, containing
prediction errors. Returns NULL if required data is missing.
}
\description{

source data, re-optimizes alpha on the remaining stations, and
predicts the removed station's demographics. This is the only form
of out-of-sample validation available.
