\usage{
plot_connections(
  result,
  top_k = NULL,
  threshold = 0.01,

}
\arguments{
\item{result}{An \code{interpElections_result} object.}

\item{top_k}{Max connections per tract. \code{NULL} shows only the
dominant connection (static) or all connections (interactive).}

\item{threshold}{Min weight for a connection to be drawn.}

\item{show_all_tracts}{Logical. Show all tract polygons as background.}

\item{palette}{Color palette.}

\item{interactive}{Logical.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (invisibly) or an htmlwidget (interactive).
}
\description{
Draws lines between tract centroids and their assigned stations.
In the static version, tracts are colored by effective number of
sources and lines are scaled by weight. In the interactive version,
clicking a station or tract reveals its connections.
